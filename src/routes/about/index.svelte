            A good story should be <strong>emotional</strong> and <strong>credible</strong>; create a <strong>connection</strong> and <strong>impact</strong> the audience.<br><br>
            Authentic stories move the needle. They inspire action. But I've learned that before you can be a good story teller, you need to be a good <strong>listener</strong>.<br><br>
            I listen to the needs and the nuances that make each client unique. I craft stories based on experiences and expectations. This individualized approach helps form and shape each distinct and remarkable story.<br><br>

            <p class="absolute top-0 py-32 px-8 md:px-16 lg:px-32 text-lg">At 3am I was driving to work to start my morning news reporter shift, when I smelled smoke. I stopped my car and got out to look around. Soon enough, I spotted enormous flames erupting from the rear of a South Minneapolis church. I called the fire department and alerted neighbors. A few hours later, I was leading the morning newscast reporting live from the scene.<br><br>
    
                In the end: faulty wiring, no one hurt, and the congregation publicly recognized me for caring enough to stop, investigate and save their church from burning to the ground.</p>
